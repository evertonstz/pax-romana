This project was initially created so I could study a little more about the [Web Bluetooth API standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API), so if you're interested in the Bluetooth implementation of this code, the folder `src/pax` and the hook `src/hooks/usePaxBluetoothServices/useBluetooth/useBluetooth.ts` are what you're looking for.
